Poly is a new language targeted at mixture of data-parallel and stream
programming

Poly features:

1.) First order dependent type inference and standard ML type inference
2.) Data-parallel nested programming, which uses variants of polyhedral model for compilation
3.) Heterogeneous partitoning on CPU and GPU units using graph partitioner
4.) LLVM code generation

And lots more...
