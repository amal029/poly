Written code for:

Optimizations

1.) Aggressive constant propagation.
2.) Constant folding leads to removal of loops, if assignment is to a constant
3.) Removing dead-code: both filters and converting stmts (e.g., unused variables) to Noop


Type inference and safety

1.) First order dependent typing
2.) Non-overflowing loop-bounds
3.) Forcing affine loop-bounds (needs a lot more testing)

Written examples:

1.) K-means.poly
2.) N-body.poly (Done)
3.) Binomial-lattice.poly (Done)


TODO

Safety checks

1.) Aggressive testing (Next 2 weeks)

2.) Transitive closures for making sure that pars are pars and
extracting parallelism, see: Induction variable analysis with delayed
abstractions (Hipeac'05).

3.) WRITE POPL PAPER (START 1st WEEK OF JUNE)

4.) Resolve these bugs:

a.) Right now the **, semantics are not implemented correctly in
constant propogation and First order type inference

To resolve bugs in constant propogation:

1.) The constants to even external functions should be resolved

In llvm generation code:

1.) The assignment to an array type is not resolved properly!! It should
be a pointer to the first element rather than the pointer to array of
elements.
